# RekasBot Interface Code Overview

This README provides an overview of the key components of the RekasBot interface code, which uses p5.js and ml5.js for interactive control through hand gestures.

## Key Components

### 1. `intro.js`

This file manages the introduction page of the interface. Key functions include:

- **`show()`**: Displays the introduction screen with background image and buttons. Handles the start and help buttons' display logic.
- **`playbox()`**: Renders the start button and handles click events to start the game.
- **`createhelp()`**: Creates a help button that opens a help page with instructions.
- **`helppage()`**: Shows the help page with instructions on controlling the bot and connecting to Arduino.

### 2. `dashboard.js`

The `dashboard.js` file is responsible for displaying the dashboard with gear and detection screen. Key functions include:

- **`showdash()`**: Draws the dashboard background and shape.
- **`showgear(gearY)`**: Displays the gear position based on hand gestures. It updates the gear's display to indicate Park (P), Drive (D), or Reverse (R) modes.
- **`showScreen(wallstop)`**: Shows obstacle detection status on the screen. Displays messages based on whether an object is detected ahead or behind.

### 3. `steeringWheel.js`

This file handles the steering wheel visualization and control. Key functions include:

- **`show(ctr)`**: Renders the steering wheel and updates its angle based on hand position.
- **`steerTurn(movementFB, wallstop)`**: Determines the bot's left/right movement based on the steering wheel's angle and current gear position.

### 4. `sketch.js`

The `sketch.js` file initializes the interface, handles video input, and manages user interactions. Key functions include:

- **`preload()`**: Loads images, sounds, and fonts before the sketch starts.
- **`setup()`**: Initializes the video capture, handpose detection, and creates instances of `ipage`, `Steer`, and `dash`.
- **`draw()`**: Main draw loop that updates the interface based on hand gestures, gear position, and obstacle detection.
- **`keyPressed()`**: Connects to Arduino when the space bar is pressed.
- **`readSerial(data)`**: Reads data from Arduino and sends control information to it.
- **`drawKeypoints()`**: Processes hand gesture data to update the steering wheel and gear positions.
- **`windowResized()`**: Adjusts canvas size when the window is resized.
- **`keyTyped()`**: Handles fullscreen toggle and returning to the intro page when specific keys are pressed.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Loads necessary assets and initializes the video and handpose detection.
   - Creates objects for the introduction page, steering wheel, and dashboard.

2. **Interaction**:
   - The introduction page allows the user to start the game or view instructions.
   - The dashboard displays gear position and obstacle detection status.
   - The steering wheel adjusts based on hand movements to control the botâ€™s direction.

3. **Communication**:
   - Hand gestures are used to control the gear and steering.
   - Data is sent to and received from Arduino to control the physical bot.
